Fea supports letrate programming.
Every fea file is also a markdown file.
Only the bits in the code blocks will be compiled.

## this part is code
```

int a       is 2
string b    is "Hello"

// This is a comment. Ends with line end //


string हिंदी  is "यूनिकोड"

```

The compiler will treat everything else as comments and ignore them.

```
fact isTrue is true
fact isFalse is false

```

The compiler will stitch all code blocks together.
