Fea supports letrate programming.
Every fea file is also a markdown file.
Only the bits in the code blocks will be compiled.

## this part is code
```
a:int -> 2
b:str -> "Hello"
// This is a comment. Ends with line end //


हिंदी:str => "यूनिकोड"

```

The compiler will treat everything else as comments and ignore them.

```
c:truth -> true
d:truth -> false
```

The compiler will stitch all code blocks together.
